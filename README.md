Window Launcher
===============

A WebOS like launcher for android 3.0 and above

This project is barely working, I have an app drawer with icons that will launch their associated applications and a blank settings page.

Checklist
---------

[ ] Make application display running apps and installed apps.

[ ] Let user get rid of running applications.

[ ] Allow user to rename pages.

[ ] Allow user to move apps to different pages.

[ ] Allow user to add/delete app pages.

[ ] Allow slider for app drawer launch apps.

[ ] Launch app on Google Play.
